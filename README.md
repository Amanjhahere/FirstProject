# FirstProject


<strong>Welcome to the Calcutta Collage repository! This project, originally created as a collage assignment for my 2nd semester, is a tribute to the vibrant city of Calcutta. Through a combination of HTML and CSS, this repository showcases essential information about Calcutta, including notable places to visit, galleries, and other intriguing facets that define the essence of this historic city. Join me on this virtual journey as we explore the rich culture, heritage, and charm of Calcutta through thisÂ repository.</strong>
